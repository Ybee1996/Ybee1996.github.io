<h1>Our story so far</h1>

  <h2>25th July 2020, Evening</h2>
<p>
What a nice day it had been. Dinner with the family, after which Agnese had received a cute gift from Yusuf! Was this a sign?

Well, Agnese had no idea what feelings hid beneath the surface of that gift, until...

Yusuf invited her into his room to have a chat. THE chat. 

He told her exactly how he felt, and wanted to know whether she felt the same. She said: I'll tell you tomorrow.

Then followed a sleepless night.
